## Paper Submission

### Instructions for Authors

For preparation of papers please follow the instructions for authors available at the [Springer LNCS Web page](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).
The length of each paper including figures and references may not exceed 16 pages.
All papers must be written in English and submitted in PDF format. 

For submission of papers, please use the EasyChair site: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coine2021](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coine2021)

Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend the workshop to present the work. 

### Proceedings

Accepted papers will be linked from the website and be accessible for participants prior to the conference.

As with previous COIN workshops, COINE will publish post-proceedings in Springer's LNCS series. Authors will be invited to submit revised and extended versions of their paper for  the post-proceedings. Details will be published closer to submission time. 

Revised papers must take into account the discussion held during the workshop; hence, only papers that are presented during the workshop will be considered for inclusion in the post-proceedings volume.
